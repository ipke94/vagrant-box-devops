A simple Vagrantfile to setup a development environment based on Ubuntu desktop with some DevOps toolset in it.

## Requisites

For running this box, you need to have the following tools:

On Windows, you can install both at once with Chocolatey with

```
choco install virtualbox vagrant
```

## Toolset

- Docker and docker-compose
